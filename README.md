## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Trained working with sass. Thought it would let me cut normalizing to a separate file and create snippets with css declarations for design text presets. That worked.

```css
@mixin text1() {
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

Going to continue practicing CSS.

### Useful resources

- [SASS overview](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - Looked through this guide to recallect, how to use SASS.
